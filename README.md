# Adafruit-ST7565-Full-Graphic-Controller
3D Printer Controller based around the Adafruit ST7565 display

This is a simple project I started to utilize a couple displays I had gotten from 
Adafruit (http://www.adafruit.com/products/250).  Initially this is just for the
RAMPS 1.4 board utilizing the basic smart adapter.  Plans are to expand the supported
platforms to include the Smoothieboard with GLCD shield and the Printrboard Rev F4.
